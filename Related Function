The DAX RELATED function works specifically for one-to-many relationships, but only from the "many" side to the "one" side.
This means that you can use the RELATED function to retrieve values from the "one" side of the relationship when you are on the "many" side.

However, if you need to retrieve values from the "many" side when you are on the "one" side, you should use the RELATEDTABLE function instead.
The RELATEDTABLE function returns a table that contains all the rows related to the current row from the specified table.

RELATEDTABLE
Total Sales = SUMX(RELATEDTABLE(Sales), Sales[Amount])

RELATED
Product Name = RELATED(Products[ProductName])
